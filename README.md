Title: Predicting Churn for Bank Customers

Given the importance of customers as the most valuable organizational assets, customer retention seems essential and fundamental for any organization. Banks are
no exception to this rule. This project applied two statistical learning methods to build a churn prediction model using data from an actual bank obtained through Kaggle.

The test used to evaluate the performance of the algorithms used is AUROC. The logistic Regression algorithm performs better than the Decision Tree. 
However, decision tree-based models can provide models with high interpretability, which can help guide banks in the construction of marketing strategies.

The code was made in R Studio, and each applied method was made from scratch.
