Title: Predicting Churn for Bank Customers

Given the importance of customers as the most valuable organization assets, customer retention seems essential and a fundamental requirement for any organization. Banks are
no exception to this rule. In this project, two statistical learning methods were applied to build a churn prediction model using data from a real bank, obtained through Kaggle.
The algorithms used in this study include Logistic Regression and Decision Tree, which is proven mature and powerful classification algorithm. Also, the results of the decision tree technique represent the characteristics of churned customers.

The test used to evaluate the performance of the algorithms used is AUROC. Logistic Regression algorithm perform better than Decision Tree. 
However, decision tree-based models can provide models with high interpretability, which can help guide banks in the construction of marketing strategies.

The code was made in R Studio, and each applied method was made from scratch.
